            Club History
        </h1>
        <div id="P23">
            <p>The cybersecurity club at Graphic Era Hill University was founded in 2021 by a group of students who were interested in cybersecurity and wanted to learn more about it. They saw a need for a community of like-minded individuals who could share their knowledge and experiences, and thus, the club was born.</p>
            <p>In the early days, the club's meetings were focused on learning about different types of cyber threats and discussing how to protect against them. Members would share articles, tutorials, and other resources to help each other stay up-to-date on the latest developments in the field.</p>
            <p>Over time, the club began to expand its scope. They started hosting workshops and training sessions, where members could gain hands-on experience with various cybersecurity tools and techniques. They also began participating in cybersecurity competitions, both on campus and nationally, and found that these events were a great way to put their skills to the test and gain real-world experience.</p>
            <p>In recent years, the club has continued to grow and evolve. They have expanded their outreach efforts, hosting events and talks for the broader college community to raise awareness about cybersecurity issues. They have also formed partnerships with local businesses and organizations, providing cybersecurity assessments and other services to help them improve their security posture.</p>
            <p>Today, the cybersecurity club at Graphic Era Hill University is a thriving community of students who are passionate about cybersecurity. They continue to learn from each other and from experts in the field, and they are dedicated to making a positive impact on the world by helping to protect against cyber threats.</p>
